# dep hellp 

_This is a fork of [are-my-node-modules-messed-up](https://github.com/ef4/are-my-node-modules-messed-up/)_, with some extra features (like guidance, ecosystem knowledge, etc)


It's all too common that your `node_modules` folder ends up with a structure that doesn't satisfy every package's stated dependencies. This tool lets you check for that and guides you through to fix the reported problems.

## Usage

```bash 
npx dephellp
```
